An accurate estimation of aeration in different hydraulic structure using conventional techniques is time-consuming and inaccurate. Hence, novel, efficient methods that are computationally fast and accurate are required. This paper presents three machine learning models: (1) Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Model, (2) Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) model, and (3) Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (I-ELM) model techniques. These techniques assess the aeration performance of the three types of Piano Key Weirs (PKWs), i.e. type A, B and C. These models have been developed considering three features, viz Cd, Cs, and Cu at different temperatures, that significantly influence the weirs' aeration efficiency. The performances of the models are measured and compared using mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). This work concludes that the I-ELM model performs the best for complete available data that does not change with time. \\n\""
